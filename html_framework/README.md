# HTML Framework

Here's the place special for *Internet* side. It mainly references from "WiFi Web Server" in WiFiNINA library.

You only need an ***"Arduino Uno WIFI R2"*** board to test it. (Follow the [instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUnoWiFiRev2) to use the board in **Arduino IDE**.)

The Wi-Fi SSID and corresponding password need to be inserted into *"wifi_secret.h"* file first. It then shows the Wi-Fi connection process and you could see the framework *(only with titles)* of our "Tortoise Smart Home" website in the board's IP address.
