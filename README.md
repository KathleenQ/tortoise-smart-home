# Tortoise Smart Home

IoT smart home artefact specially for pet tortoises

5 main functions: *(not in significance order)* temperature, land-water swap, water changing, feeding, lighting

*[All functions are relatively separate from one to another. Generally, in each of them, the actuators will be controlled through the corresponding sensors' data or remote website command -- there are program judgements on whether the data is in a specific condition range or there is html "button" control.]*

## Detailed Explanations (in different folders)

["separate_function"](https://github.com/KathleenQ/tortoise-smart-home/tree/master/separate_function): Separate functions are **described in detail** and the **required hardware** are respectively listed. 

["html_framework"](https://github.com/KathleenQ/tortoise-smart-home/tree/master/html_framework): **Software basic setup** and **website framework** are shown.

["combination"](https://github.com/KathleenQ/tortoise-smart-home/tree/master/combination): Special **odd-even** setting with multi-function working.

["final_version"](https://github.com/KathleenQ/tortoise-smart-home/tree/master/final_version): **Line connection** is helped to re-create the artefact. **Website monitor** shows detailed descriptions for website control and usage. A **simple** (intermediate) test YouTube **demo** is also shown here.

I also invite you to read my [design rationale](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/news/2019/02/18/kathleen-s-design-rationale/) to learn the whole process of inspiration, iteration and implementation of artefact.

## Further Contact

As the artefact looks relatively completed and nearly no similar product could be found in market, I really hope it could have further development and do help pet tortoises and their lovely owners enjoy a better life~
